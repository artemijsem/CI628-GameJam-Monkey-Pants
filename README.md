# IDE setup for Client

To be able to edit the code for the client you need to have a `build` folder that CMake creates.
You can either follow [Almas' tutorial](https://github.com/AlmasB/CI628-PongClient#build) for that or run `CMake_Build.bat` file that I have created.
In second case you would need to have your CMake folder extracted into the same folder where you have the repo.
